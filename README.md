# Welcome to PowerDale

PowerDale is a small town with around 100 residents. Most houses have a smartmeter installed that can save and send information
about how much energy a house has used.

There are three major providers of energy in town that charge different amounts for the power they supply.

- _Dr Evil's Dark Energy_
- _The Green Eco_
- _Power for Everyone_

# Introducing JOI Energy

JOI Energy is a new startup in the energy industry.
Rather than selling energy they want to differentiate themselves from the market by recording their customers' energy usage from their smartmeters and
recommending the best supplier to meet their needs.

You have been placed into their development team, whose current goal is to produce an API which their customers and smart meters will interact with.

Unfortunately, two members of the team are on annual leave, and another one has called in sick!
You are left with a ThoughtWorker to progress with the current user stories on the story wall. This is your chance to make an impact on the business, improve the code base and deliver value.

## Story Wall

At JOI energy the development team use a story wall or kanban board to keep track of features or "stories" as they are worked on.

The wall you will be working from today has 7 columns:

- Backlog
- Ready for Dev
- In Dev
- Ready for Testing
- In Testing
- Ready for sign off
- Done

Examples can be found here https://leankit.com/learn/kanban/kanban-board/
